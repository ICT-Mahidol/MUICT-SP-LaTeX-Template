An``abstract'' is a concise summary that provides an overview of a research paper, article, or study. It serves as a brief snapshot of the research's purpose, methods, results, and conclusions. The abstract is usually placed at the beginning of the research document and is intended to help readers quickly understand the key aspects of the study without needing to read the entire paper.

The abstract's primary purpose is to provide readers with a quick overview of the research's content and relevance. It helps individuals decide whether the full research paper is worth reading by giving them an understanding of what to expect. Due to its succinct nature, crafting an effective abstract requires careful selection of key information and clear, concise writing.
